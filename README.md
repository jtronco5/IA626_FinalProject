# IA626_FinalProject

 ## Summary:

 This project will show a time series analysis of average gas prices throughout New York State (NYS). The objective is to see if COVID-19 caused an impact on gas prices to fluctuate in a certain way. My hypothesis is that gas prices decreased during the beginning part of the pandemic since less people were traveling since majority of employees were working remotely and lots business were shutting down temporarily. Also, I would expect to see gas prices to increase in the data for the current time period since the economy is back to some degree of normalcy and there are shortages of gas production and truck drivers to deliver the gas. Both potential trends in gas would be due to supply and demand forces that were impacted by the pandemic. 

Two data sets were used to conduct this analysis. Both data sets came from the NYS governmentâ€™s website; the gas price data was collected from NYSERDA and the COVID data was collected from the NYS Department of Health. The gas price data shows average gas prices on a weekly basis for a subset of regions in NYS from 10/29/2007 to 12/6/2021. The COVID data shows the daily and cumulative positive cases for all the counties in NYS from 3/1/2020 to 12/9/2021. The links for both data sets can be seen below.
